## Order up

You want to have a variety of balloons for a party. You can only order balloons in sets of 3.

This order placed was:

> 4 sets of red, 3 sets of blue, and 3 sets of yellow.

The price for each set of balloons is: 

> R4 for red, R5 for blue, and R5.50 for yellow.

Use the strings as your starting point. 

Use TDD and write functions that answer these questions:

* How many of each colour balloon did we order?
* How much do all the balloons cost?
* If it costs R2.00 to inflate each balloon with helium, how much extra would that cost?
* If there are 25 people coming to the party, are there enough balloons for everyone to get one balloon? Do you have any spare?

## Pop, pop!

**During the party**
 
 
 > 5 red balloons, 1 blue balloon, and 3 yellow balloons popped
* How many people wonâ€™t have balloons?
* Which colour has the most balloons, and which one has the least?
